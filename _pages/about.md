I have completed M.Tech with Research Assistantship from [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](http://iith.ac.in/)(IITH), supervised by [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html). I work in the area of Computer Vision and Graph Analysis. Specifically, generalizing Deep Learning concepts for graphs i.e. non-Euclidean data. My M.Tech thesis topic was **"Undestanding Graph Data Through Deep Leaning Lens"** and final year work is under review at AAAI 2019. I also **write blogs** about my understanding of papers on Geometric Deep Learning ([cnnforgraphs.blogspot.in](http://cnnforgraphs.blogspot.in/)). 

My research interest include: Computer Vision, Visual Question Answering, Social Graph analysis, Data Mining. I am also looking for an opportunity to do PhD.

Please find my **resume** [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1disjTh3EbEuH2j-KCoDxZrZDlwQKUTLt/view?usp=sharing).

I am always open to work on new challenging problems from different domains. Please feel free to send me an email([cs15mtech11016@iith.ac.in](cs15mtech11016@iith.ac.in)) if you would like to collaborate.
