I am final year M.Tech. student at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](http://iith.ac.in/), supervised by [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html). I am currently working in the area of Geometric Deep Learning: generalizing Deep Learning concepts for graphs and manifolds (i.e. non-Euclidean data). I recently started writing blog about my understanding of papers on Geometric Deep Learning ([cnnforgraphs.blogspot.in](http://cnnforgraphs.blogspot.in/)). My research interest include: Social Graph analysis, Data Mining, Computer Vision, Visual Question Answering.

I am always open to work on new challenging problems from different domains. Please feel free to send me an email([cs15mtech11016@iith.ac.in](cs15mtech11016@iith.ac.in)) if you would like to collaborate.
