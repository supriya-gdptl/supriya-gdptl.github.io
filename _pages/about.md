<!--I completed a Research-based Master's degree in Computer Science in June 2023 from Simon Fraser University, advised by [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io/).--> <!--I work at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision and graphics. -->
<!--Currently, I am a Research Intern at Huawei Research Center, Vancouver. -->

<!--My research work explores developing and evaluating deep learning models for vision/graphics tasks such as 3D shape and scene understanding.  -->
<!-- the  in the area of 3D indoor scene understanding and my current project focuses on evaluating different deep learning methods for detecting rotated instances of 3D objects in a given scene mesh. -->
<!-- My current work focuses on 3D indoor scene understanding, which includes learning object arrangement in a scene to reconstruct a given scene or generate a new one.  -->

<!--I completed Masters' degree from the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](http://iith.ac.in/)(IITH), supervised by [Prof. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html). During this period, I worked on computer vision and graph neural networks.-->

<!--I have completed M.Tech with Research Assistantship from [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](http://iith.ac.in/)(IITH), guided by [Prof. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html). I work in the area of Computer Vision and Graph Analysis. Specifically, generalizing Deep Learning concepts for graphs i.e. non-Euclidean data. My M.Tech thesis topic was **"Undestanding Graph Data Through Deep Leaning Lens"**\[[Link](http://raiith.iith.ac.in/4093/1/Thesis_Mtech_CS_4093.pdf)\]. I also **write blogs** on my understanding of Geometric Deep Learning papers ([cnnforgraphs.blogspot.in](http://cnnforgraphs.blogspot.in/)). -->

I am a Machine Learning Researcher working in the Computer Vision (2D/3D) domain. I have 8 years of experience in Machine Learning and around 2 years in Software Engineering, making me proficient in both analytical methodologies and software development.

I am looking for a full-time role as a Machine Learning Engineer / Software Engineer / Data Analyst. If your team has any open position that aligns with my profile, please reach out to me. <!--I'd appreciate the opportunity to chat about potential opportunities.-->
