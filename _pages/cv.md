Research Projects
======
* Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Image Completion:
  - Completed as a course project for Deep Learning for Vision course
  - Goal is to use GANs for completion of face images, important in many applications such as surveillance. 
  - Implemented in Python-TensorFlow.
  - Mentor: [Vineeth N Balasubramanian](http://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/).

* Inverse Search:
  - Completed as a course project for Information Retrieval course
  - The goal is, given a set of documents, find the most probable query that might have generated these documents. 
  - Used ensemble of 3 algorithms:TF-IDF based, LDA based and TextRank. 
  - Implemented using Python NLTK, Java MALLET.
  - Mentor: [Maunendra Desarkar](http://www.iith.ac.in/~maunendra/)
