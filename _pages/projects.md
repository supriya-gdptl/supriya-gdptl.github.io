-    ### 3D chair Mix-N-Match Modeling:
     -    Completed as a part of CMPT 764 Geometric Modeling in Computer Graphics course.
     -    Given a set of 3D chairs with segmented parts, the goal is to implement an automated mix-n-match part
assembly based 3D modeling method, along with designing a plausibility scoring scheme to evaluate the quality of the generated 3D models.
     -    The model includes three subparts: 
          -    Parser: takes a set of pre-segmented and labeled 3D chairs as input and learns a internal representation so that it can be further processed. For this step, we used tree representation, based on [GRASS](https://github.com/PeppaZhu/grass) model, for parsing 3D chairs and recomposing parts from different models to produce new 3D model.
          -    Mixer: takes different parts from different chairs, transforms them and recomposes into new chair. We modified the tree branches generated by Parser to incorporate part-level transformations adn recomposing.
          -    Scorer: takes in a new 3D model and outputs a score that tells the likeliness of it being a a chair. We used [MVCNN](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/mvcnn/) to calculate view-based score and [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) Physics Similation API to calculate physics-based score.


-   ### Language-based Video Moment Localization:
    -    Completed as a part of CMPT 726 Machine Learning course.
    -    We address the problem of language-based temporal localization of moments inuntrimmed videos.
    -    We extend the [MAC model](https://github.com/runzhouge/MAC) by introducing object semantic segmentation features and video captioning features for visual domain and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) features for language domain. With these changes we could achieve bettr performance over the MAC.

-   ### The 2nd YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge:
    -  Designing a machine learning model with size constrained of 1GB to predict video labels. Experimented with three different architectures. 
    -  Our team could achieve the **Global Average Precision (GAP) score of 0.82853** with final **rank of 104** among the participated 394 teams across the different countries.

-   ### Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Image Completion:
    -  Goal is to use GANs for completion of face images, important in many applications such as surveillance.
    -  Implemented in TensorFlow. Completed as a course project for Deep Learning for Vision course.

    -  [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W7NhIt8XP5HToKYoKbhTCMHokylXQDYx/view?usp=sharing)

-  ### Inverse Search:
   -  The goal is, given a set of documents, find the most probable query that might have generated these documents. Used ensemble of 3 algorithms:TF-IDF based, LDA based and TextRank.
   -  Implemented using Python NLTK, Java MALLET. Completed as a course project for Information Retrieval course.
   -  Mentor: [Dr. Maunendra Desarkar](http://www.iith.ac.in/~maunendra/)

-  ### Time-table Generation Using Genetic Algorithm:
   -  Every semester the university needs to generate the class time-table that satisfies certain hard-constraint and soft-constraints. **Generating optimal time-table** manually is laborious and challenging task. Hence, we designed an algorithm that makes this process automatic. 
   -  We considered six factors: department, class, course, weekday, time and room. We constructed a string of integer numbers indicating factors that are allocated. This **string indicates the chromosome**. Based on whether this allocation satisfies constraints the fitness score for this chromosome is calculated. We then use **two-point crossover and mutation** to find optimal chromosome (i.e. time-table).
   -  This project was part of my **B.Tech Thesis** and completed during final year of B.Tech at [VIT](http://www.vit.edu/index.php)

- ### Exam-scheduling Using Graph Coloring Algorithm:
   -  In university, the courses are offered to students from different departments. Hence, while scheduling an exam for such courses, examination authorities need to take care that exam time-slot should not clash with other courses for which students have already registered.
   -  To solve this problem, we constructed a **graph with courses as nodes** and edge indicates that there exist at least one student who has registered for both courses (represented by two end nodes of an edge).
   -  This formulation has **simplified the problem of exam scheduling to graph coloring**, where color of the node represents the time-slot of alloted for the course. As per the graph coloring algorithm, we need to assign colors to nodes such a way that no two adjacent nodes can have same colors.
   -  This project was completed during my **third year of B.Tech**
