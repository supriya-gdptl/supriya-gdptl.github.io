* **Evaluating 3D Shape Analysis Methods for Robustness to Rotation Invariance**
    * Accepted for Oral Presentation at [Conference on Robots and Vision (CRV) 2023](https://www.computerrobotvision.org/)
    * We analyze the robustness of recent 3D shape descriptors to SO(3) rotations, something that is fundamental to shape modeling. 
    * We benchmark different methods for feature extraction and classification in the context of _Instance Classification_ task.
    * We systematically contrast different choices in a variety of experimental settings investigating the impact on the performance under: 
       * different rotation distributions
       * different degrees of partial observations on the object
       * different levels of difficulty of negative pairs
    * Our study provides useful pointers in making design choices for modeling rotation-invariance for shape encoding.


* **STWalk: Learning Trajectory Representations in Temporal Graphs**

    * Accepted as main research track paper in [CoDS-COMAD 2018](http://cods-comad.in/2018/index.html). STWalk analyzes the temporal behavior of nodes in dynamic graphs by doing random walks on graph at a current & past time-steps. STWalk outperforms baseline algorithms on 3 real-world datasets. Implemented in Python, TensorFlow-Keras.

* **Community-based Outlier Detection in Edge-attributed Graphs**

    * The paper introduces a novel method that detects holistic outlier graph nodes by taking into account the node data and edge data simultaneously to detect anomalies.
