## STWalk: Learning Trajectory Representations in Temporal Graphs

STWalk analyzes the temporal behavior of nodes in dynamic graphs by doing random walks on graph at a current & past time-steps. STWalk outperforms baseline algorithms on 3 real-world datasets. Implemented in Python, TensorFlow-Keras.
